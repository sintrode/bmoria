# bmoria
A batch port of [Umoria](https://github.com/dungeons-of-moria/umoria), one of the older roguelikes. _Moria_ - the previous iteration - was written by Robert Alan Koeneke and _Umoria_ was a C port by James E. Wilson.

# Requirements
Due to the game using VT100 escape sequences, Windows 10 or later is required. Use of conhost rather than Windows Terminal is strongly recommended due to Terminal's current lack of support for the `mode con` command, but it is not required.
